0. We strongly recommend using the Ananconda Python distribution to ensure you have all the required packages.
   While PCML will work with a minimal Python installation, several features will be disabled if you do not have geospatial tools such as GDAL.
   Ananconda can be downloaded here: http://continuum.io/downloads

   Windows installation instructions can be found on the PCML Github page: https://github.com/hpcgislab/pcml
   
   Using Anaconda (Anaconda Prompt or conda) you can run:
   
   pip install gdal
   
   To install gdal and be able to read and write geotiff and other geospatial data files.

1. PCML can be executed from this working directory without installation.
   Just run 'demo_30min.py' or 'examples.py' to start using PCML.
   
   (Note: gdal is not required to run the 30 minute demo)

2. For Linux installations make sure that pip and setuptools are installed in your current Python environment (global or a virtualenv). Note: Installation is not required, you can run PCML 'in place' without running the following commands.

3. Run the following commands:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt # Need to use pip to install numpy and other required packages or the next line will fail
    $ python setup.py install

4. Testing and code coverage

    $ python setup.py test

Congratulations, you have the latest PCML version installed.
